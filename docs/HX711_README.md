```

The on-chip **programmable gain amplifier (PGA)** amplifies the tiny differential signal from the bridge (typically 0 – 20 mV full scale) before it reaches the ADC. A higher gain improves resolution at the cost of a smaller maximum input range.

---

## Load Cell Fundamentals

A **strain gauge load cell** works by bonding metallic foil resistors to a metal beam. When a force is applied, the beam deflects slightly, stretching some resistors and compressing others. The resistance change is typically very small (< 1%).

### Half-Bridge vs Full-Bridge

A **half-bridge** cell has two active gauges (one in tension, one in compression). Its differential output signal is:

```
V_out = (V_EXC / 2) × (ΔR / R)
```

A **full Wheatstone bridge** uses four gauges (two in tension, two in compression) and doubles the output signal:

```
V_out = V_EXC × (ΔR / R)
```

More signal → better resolution and noise immunity.

### Combining Four Half-Bridge Cells

The four 50 kg half-bridge cells used in this project are wired to form a **single full Wheatstone bridge**:

```
         E+ ──────┬──────────────────┬────── E+
                  │                  │
             Cell 1 (tension)   Cell 2 (tension)
                  │                  │
         A+ ──────┤                  ├────── A+
                  │                  │
             Cell 3 (compression) Cell 4 (compression)
                  │                  │
         A- ──────┴──────────────────┴────── A-
                  │
         E- ──────┘
```

**Practical wiring:**

| HX711 terminal | What to connect |
|----------------|-----------------|
| E+ | Red wires of Cells 1 & 3 (tied together) |
| E− | Black wires of Cells 1 & 3 (tied together) |
| A+ | White wires of Cells 2 & 4 (tied together) |
| A− | Green/Yellow wires of Cells 2 & 4 (tied together) |

With this arrangement the four cells share the mechanical load and their signals add constructively, giving a combined full-scale capacity of **200 kg** (4 × 50 kg).

> **Important:** The physical placement of the cells in the scale frame matters. Cells 1 and 3 must be on one diagonal of the platform, and Cells 2 and 4 on the other. This ensures tensile and compressive forces cancel correctly.

## HX711 Pin Description

| Pin | Name | Direction | Description |
|-----|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | VSUP | Power | Analog supply (2.6 – 5.5 V) |
| 2 | BASE | Output | Internal bias (connect 100 nF to GND) |
| 3 | AGND | Power | Analog ground |
| 4 | VFB | Input | Voltage regulator feedback |
| 5 | AVDD | Output | Regulated analog supply for bridge excitation |
| 6 | VBG | Output | Band-gap reference output |
| 7 | INA− | Input | Channel A differential input − |
| 8 | INA+ | Input | Channel A differential input + |
| 9 | INB− | Input | Channel B differential input − |
| 10 | INB+ | Input | Channel B differential input + |
| 11 | PD_SCK | Input | Power-down control & serial clock |
| 12 | DOUT | Output | Serial data output |
| 13 | RATE | Input | Output data rate: LOW = 10 Hz, HIGH = 80 Hz |
| 14 | DVDD | Power | Digital supply (2.6 – 5.5 V) |

> On the common **HX711 breakout module** many of these pins are internally wired. You only need to connect: VCC, GND, E+, E−, A+, A−, DOUT (DT), and SCK (PD_SCK).

---

## Power Supply Considerations

- The HX711 can run from 3.3 V or 5 V; **this project uses 3.3 V** to be compatible with the ESP32's GPIO voltage.
- Keep power and signal traces separate on the PCB/breadboard.
- Place a **100 nF ceramic decoupling capacitor** close to VCC.
- The **AVDD output pin** (excitation voltage for the bridge) follows the supply voltage, so at 3.3 V the bridge is excited with ~3.3 V.

---

## Channel and Gain Selection

The HX711 supports two input channels with different gain settings:

| Channel | Gain | Input range (at 3.3 V supply) |
|---------|------|-------------------------------|
| A | 128 | ±20 mV |
| A | 64 | ±40 mV |
| B | 32 | ±80 mV |

This project always uses **Channel A, Gain 128** (`HX711_GAIN_A_128`) for maximum resolution. The gain is selected by the number of extra SCK pulses sent after the 24 data bits of each conversion (see next section).

---

## Output Data Rate

The RATE pin controls the conversion speed:

| RATE pin level | Conversions per second |
|----------------|------------------------|
| LOW (or floating) | 10 Hz |
| HIGH | 80 Hz |

At 10 Hz with 10-sample averaging, one calibrated reading takes ~1 second.
At 80 Hz with 10-sample averaging, one reading takes ~125 ms.

> On most breakout modules the RATE pin is pulled LOW by default (10 Hz). The driver does not currently control RATE — wire it directly if 80 Hz is needed.

---

## Serial Communication Protocol

The HX711 uses a **custom 2-wire synchronous serial protocol** driven entirely by the master (ESP32). No standard SPI/I2C peripheral is used; all timing is implemented in software (bit-banging).

### Timing Diagram

```

T1 (SCK HIGH width) ≥ 0.2 µs
T2 (SCK LOW  width) ≥ 0.2 µs
T3 (DOUT valid after SCK falls) ≤ 0.1 µs — data is stable before host samples
```

### Data Format

The HX711 outputs a **24-bit two's complement** value, MSB first. After sign extension to 32 bits, the value ranges from −8 388 608 to +8 388 607.

Example:
```
Received bits: 0b 0000 0110 1001 1110 0000 1010  (hex: 0x069E0A)
Decimal: 432 650
Meaning: 432 650 raw counts above the negative full-scale
```

### Gain-Select Pulse Count

After the 24 data bits are clocked out, the master sends **1, 2, or 3 additional SCK pulses** to select the gain for the *next* conversion:

| Extra pulses | Next conversion gain |
|---|---|
| 1 | Channel A, gain 128 |
| 2 | Channel B, gain 32 |
| 3 | Channel A, gain 64 |

In the driver this is implemented as:

```c
for (int i = 0; i < (int)dev->cfg.gain; i++) {
    hx711_clock_pulse(dev);
}
```

where `dev->cfg.gain` is one of the `hx711_gain_t` enum values (1, 2, or 3).

---

## Power-Down Mode

Holding PD_SCK HIGH for more than **60 µs** puts the HX711 into power-down mode, drawing < 1 µA. The driver implements this as:

```c
gpio_set_level(sck_pin, 1);
ets_delay_us(65);   // > 60 µs
```

To wake up, drive PD_SCK LOW. The HX711 requires approximately **400 ms** after power-up for the internal oscillator and analog circuitry to stabilise. The first sample after wake-up should be discarded or the measurement task should delay before reading.

---

## Noise and Resolution

At 24-bit resolution the theoretical LSB size is:

```
LSB = V_FS / 2^24 / Gain
    = 20 mV / 16 777 216 / 128
    ≈ 0.000 000 93 V  (< 1 nV per count)
```

In practice, thermal noise, board layout, and power supply noise limit effective resolution to roughly **20–21 effective bits**, which corresponds to:

```
Effective counts ≈ 2^20 = 1 048 576
Weight resolution ≈ 200 000 g / 1 048 576 ≈ 0.19 g
```

**Techniques used in this project to reduce noise:**

1. **Multi-sample averaging** — `hx711_read_average()` with `CONFIG_SCALE_SAMPLES = 10` averages out random noise, improving SNR by √10 ≈ 3×.
2. **Zero threshold** — `CONFIG_ZERO_THRESHOLD_G = 2.0` suppresses sub-2 g fluctuations around tare.
3. **Interrupt-disabled clock sequence** — `portDISABLE_INTERRUPTS()` during the 24-bit read prevents ESP32 task switches from stretching the SCK pulse and corrupting the data.

---

## Calibration Mathematics

Raw ADC values are converted to physical weight using two parameters:

### 1. Tare Offset

Captured with no load on the scale:
```
tare = average_raw_counts_with_empty_platform
```

### 2. Scale Factor

Captured with a known reference weight W_ref on the platform:
```
raw_loaded = average_raw_counts_with_W_ref
delta      = raw_loaded - tare
scale      = delta / W_ref      [units: counts per gram]
```

### Weight Calculation

```
weight_g = (raw_reading - tare) / scale
```

**Worked example:**

| Step | Value |
|------|-------|
| Tare (empty) | −47 382 counts |
| Loaded with 1000 g | 383 618 counts |
| Delta | 431 000 counts |
| Scale factor | 431 000 / 1000 = **431.0 counts/g** |
| Reading under unknown load (420 000 counts) | (420 000 − (−47 382)) / 431.0 = **1084.5 g** |

## Driver Implementation Notes

### Why IRAM?

The `hx711_clock_pulse()` helper is declared `IRAM_ATTR` (placed in internal RAM). On the ESP32, flash cache misses can stall instruction fetch for 20–100 µs — far longer than the required SCK cycle time of ~2 µs. Placing the hot path in IRAM guarantees timing accuracy regardless of flash activity.

### Why `portDISABLE_INTERRUPTS()`?

The 24 + N clock pulse sequence must complete without interruption. An ISR firing mid-sequence would hold SCK HIGH for the ISR duration, which could accidentally trigger power-down (> 60 µs) or corrupt the bit stream. Interrupts are re-enabled immediately after the final gain-select pulse.

### Why `ets_delay_us()` Instead of `vTaskDelay()`?

`vTaskDelay()` has a minimum resolution of one FreeRTOS tick (1 ms at 1000 Hz). The SCK duty cycle requires ~1 µs high and ~1 µs low. `ets_delay_us()` is a ROM-based busy-wait loop that provides microsecond accuracy without a context switch.

### Sign Extension

The raw 24-bit value is stored in a `uint32_t` during bit accumulation. It must be sign-extended to `int32_t` before arithmetic:

```c
if (data & 0x800000U) {   // bit 23 = sign bit
    data |= 0xFF000000U;  // extend sign to bits 31–24
}
*raw = (int32_t)data;
```

Without this step, negative readings (object pulling the scale upward) would appear as large positive numbers.

## Common Mistakes

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Always reads max positive | A+ / A− swapped | Swap the bridge signal wires |
| Always reads max negative | E+ / E− swapped | Swap the excitation wires |
| Readings jump erratically | Loose connection or poor ground | Check all solder joints; add decoupling cap |
| Scale factor appears correct but weight drifts | Temperature coefficient of load cells | Re-tare after warm-up; use precision cells |
| `ESP_ERR_TIMEOUT` on every read | DOUT never goes LOW | Check VCC; verify SCK is not stuck HIGH; check wiring |
| Reading is correct sign but wrong magnitude | Wrong scale factor | Re-calibrate with a known weight |
| Readings stable but offset from zero | Tare not set | Call `hx711_tare()` with empty platform |
| Reading doubles under known weight | Two cells wired in parallel instead of bridge | Re-wire as full bridge (see wiring section) |
